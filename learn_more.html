    <h2>Islam Definition </h2>
    <img src="lern more.png" alt="quran">
    <p>Islam (Arabic: الإسلام; Alʾislām, "submission") is an
        Abrahamic religion based on the dogma of absolute monotheism (تَوْحيد, tawheed) and has its source in the Qur'an, considered to be the receptacle of
        the word of God (الله, Allah) revealed, in the seventh century in Arabia,
        to Muhammad (محمّد, Muḥammad), proclaimed by the adherents of Islam as the last prophet of God.Islam</p>

    <h3>A follower of Islam is called a Muslim; he has religious duties, often called the «pillars of Islam». Muslims believe that God is one and indivisible and that Islam is the natural religion in the sense that it does not need faith in the divine oneness to ascertain the existence of God, this truth being given entirely from the first day and from the first Man (Adam). Thus, it presents itself as a return to the steps of Abraham (called, in Arabic, Ibrahim), in an exclusive submission to the will of Allah.

        In 2015, the number of Muslims in the world is estimated at 1.8 billion, or 24% of the world’s population, making Islam the second religion in the world after Christianity and ahead of Hinduism. Islam is divided into different currents, the main ones being Sunnism, which represents 90% of Muslims, Shiism and Kharidjism.
        
        Islam is, chronologically speaking, the third great monotheistic current of the family of Abrahamic religions, after Judaism and Christianity, with which it has common elements. The Qur'an recognizes the divine origin of all the sacred books of these religions, while considering that they would be, in their current interpretations, the result of a partial falsification: the Folios of Abraham, the Tawrat (the Book of Moses identified with the Torah), the Zabur of David and Solomon (identified in the Book of Psalms) and the Injil (the Gospel of Jesus).
        
        Islam attaches great importance to the Sunnah of Muhammad, whose Muslim tradition has reported words, deeds and gestures. These stories, called Hadîths, to which the majority of Muslims refer for the establishment of legal rules (fiqh), make it possible to codify the Muslim faith and practice. The different branches of Islam do not agree on compilations of hadiths to remember. The Qur'an and the so-called «admissible» hadiths are two of the four sources of Islamic law (Sharia)  the other two being consensus (ijmâ') and analogy (qiyâs).

        Etymology
        The word «Islam» is the transliteration of Arabic الإسلام, islām listen, meaning: «submission and subjection to the orders of God»2. It is an action name (in Arabic اسم فعل ism fi'l), which refers to the act of voluntarily submitting oneself, derived from a Semitic radical, s.l.m, at the origin of a class of words meaning concord, completeness, integrity or paix3. The agent name (in Arabic اسم فاعل ism fā'il) derived from this root is م س ل م muslim “the one who is thinned” in old arabFootnote 1, but “the one who submits” in modern Arabic, at the origin of the French word Muslim. In the first community, the believer bore the name of mu'minun and not that of muslimun5. It was only later that this religion took the name IslamNote 2,6.
        
        Particularly in ancient chivalry novels, the terms “Mahometism” (formerly “Mohammedanism”7) and “Mohammedan” have fallen into disuse for more than a century. These terms both derive from the French name «Mahomet». The Muslim religion was later referred to in French as “islamism” (as “judaism”, “christianisme”, “buddhism”, “animism”, etc.). This term is of French creation and its use is attested in French since the seventeenth century, Voltaire using it instead of «mahometism» to mean «religion of Muslims». In the twentieth century, the word “Islamism”, replaced by the word “Islam” in this old sense, changed its meaning and specialized to refer to the political use of Islam9, Islamism then becoming a political doctrine that aims at the expansion of Islam10. The terms “islam” and “muslim” have been commonly used in French only since the twentieth century7.
        
        The word “Islam” with a lowercase denotes the religion of which the Prophet is Muhammad. The term “Islam” with a uppercase denotes  Islamic civilization as a whole,12“a set of durable and identifiable material, cultural and social traits.” It designates, beyond religion itself with its faith and worship, a political power and a movement of general civilization.

        The word «Muslim» (with a capital letter) used to refer to one of the national communities within the former Yugoslavia (distinct nationality since 1974) and still refers to it in some of the States which are issued therefrom. At the time of the Third Reich, in concentration camps, the word «Muslim» or «muselmann» is used to designate «the weak, the unsuitable, those who were dedicated to selection»</h3>
